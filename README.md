# Pedestrian Injury Classification with DistilBERT and LoRA
This project builds a transformer-based classifier to identify pedestrian injuries from narrative records in the NEISS (National Electronic Injury Surveillance System) database. It leverages the Hugging Face transformers library and fine-tunes a DistilBERT model using Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (LoRA) to reduce computational overhead while maintaining strong performance.

Currently, the model achieves 80.0% accuracy and 83.3% precision on a held-out test set.

The project is open-source and actively in progress.
Contributions and collaboration are welcome!
